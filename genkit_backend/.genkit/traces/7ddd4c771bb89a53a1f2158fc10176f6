Review the following group of orders and determine whether they are efficiently grouped. Perform the following 7 steps and provide small detailed reasoning for each in your final output, structured clearly with sections for each step. For each step, include all calculations, decisions, assumptions, and comparisons made during the evaluation.\\n\\n1. **Calculate Optimal Route Distance**:\\n   - Use the pickupPlace and deliveryPlace coordinates (latitude, longitude) for each order to compute the total distance of an optimized route.\\n   - Optimize the route by prioritizing the pickupTimeWindow and deliveryTimeWindow first, arranging the sequence to respect the earliest start times and avoid conflicts (e.g., start with the earliest pickup, proceed to the next compatible pickup or delivery).\\n   - After time optimization, refine the sequence geographically by minimizing backtracking (e.g., pickup of first order, pickup of second order, then deliveries, or pickup then delivery per order), ending at the last delivery.\\n   - Use Euclidean distance (sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2)) between coordinates if exact routing is unavailable, converting degrees to approximate kilometers (1 degree ≈ 111 km).\\n   - If the calculated distance deviates significantly from real-world estimates (e.g., >20% difference) or cannot be computed accurately due to missing data or complexity, use the provided totalDistance as a fallback (assume it is 90% correct).\\n   - Compare your calculated or fallback distance with the provided totalDistance to assess consistency.\\n   - **Reasoning Requirements**: Explain the time-based sequence chosen (based on pickupTimeWindow and deliveryTimeWindow), refine with geographic optimization, show distance calculations between each pair of locations (or why calculation failed), state whether the calculated or fallback distance was used, and compare it with the provided totalDistance.\\n\\n2. **Calculate Price Per Km**:\\n   - Compute pricePerKm as totalPrice / totalDistance, using the distance determined in Step 1 (calculated or fallback).\\n   - If the fallback totalDistance was used, compare with the provided pricePerKm (assume it is 90% correct) and decide which to adopt.\\n   - Verify that pricePerKm falls within 1.5–2.5 €/km; if outside this range, flag it as an issue.\\n   - **Reasoning Requirements**: Show the exact computation (e.g., totalPrice ÷ totalDistance = pricePerKm), state which distance and pricePerKm values were used, explain if the provided pricePerKm was adopted, and confirm if the result is within the acceptable range.\\n\\n3. **Validate Car Type Compatibility**:\\n   - Check that all orders share the same carTypeName.\\n   - Use these car type constraints:\\n     - **MEGA**: height: 3.0m, length: 13.6m, width: 2.48m, maxWeight: 25.0t, capacity: 34 pallets, loadingMethods: [\\\"Rear\\\", \\\"Side\\\", \\\"Top\\\"]\\n     - **TAUTLINER_PLANA**: height: 2.62m, length: 13.6m, width: 2.46m, maxWeight: 24.0t, capacity: 34 pallets, loadingMethods: [\\\"Rear\\\", \\\"Side\\\", \\\"Top\\\"]\\n     - **Frigo**: height: 2.6m, length: 13.4m, width: 2.46m, maxWeight: 22.0t, capacity: 33 pallets, loadingMethods: [\\\"Rear\\\"]\\n   - Assume orders’ dimensions and loading needs fit unless specified otherwise, but flag if car types differ.\\n   - **Reasoning Requirements**: List the carTypeName for each order, confirm they match, identify the car type used, and verify that its constraints (e.g., maxWeight, capacity) support the group.\\n\\n4. **Check Truck Limits**:\\n   - Ensure total LDM (loading meters) is less than 13.6.\\n   - Ensure total weight is less than the car type’s maxWeight (based on the car type identified in Step 3).\\n   - **Reasoning Requirements**: Provide the calculated total LDM and total weight from the input, state the car type’s limits, and compare these values to confirm compliance or identify violations.\\n\\n5. **Validate Time Windows**:\\n   - Check compatibility of pickupTimeWindow and deliveryTimeWindow for all orders with the optimized route from Step 1.\\n   - Estimate travel time between locations using the totalDistance from Step 1 and an average speed of 60 km/h (distance ÷ 60 = hours).\\n   - Assume pickups and deliveries occur at the start of their respective time windows unless overlap prevents this, then adjust sequence as needed.\\n   - **Reasoning Requirements**: List each order’s pickup and delivery time windows, estimate travel times between stops based on the route, and explain if the sequence satisfies all time constraints or where conflicts arise.\\n\\n6. **Validate ADR Rules**:\\n   - Rules:\\n     - If any order has isAdrOrder: true, all ADR orders must have canGroupWithAdr: true to group together, and all non-ADR orders must have canGroupWithAdr: true to group with ADR orders.\\n     - An ADR order with canGroupWithAdr: false can only group with non-ADR orders that have canGroupWithAdr: false.\\n     - If no orders have isAdrOrder: true (all are non-ADR orders), all orders can group with each other regardless of their canGroupWithAdr values.\\n   - **Reasoning Requirements**: List each order’s isAdrOrder and canGroupWithAdr values, analyze grouping compatibility step-by-step according to the rules, and state whether the group satisfies ADR requirements or where it fails.\\n\\n7. **Check Destination Proximity and Routing**:\\n   - Ensure all pickup and delivery locations are within a 200 km radius, using straight-line distance between coordinates (Euclidean, 1 degree ≈ 111 km).\\n   - Validate cross-country routes (e.g., FR to DE) if present, ensuring they align with the optimized route from Step 1.\\n   - Confirm the route sequence is efficient (e.g., minimizes backtracking or detours).\\n   - **Reasoning Requirements**: Calculate distances between all pairs of pickup and delivery locations, confirm all are within 200 km, verify cross-country validity, describe the route sequence, and explain its optimization or any inefficiencies.\\n\\n**Output Instructions**:\\nReturn a JSON object in this exact format:\\n{\\n  \\\"isGoodGroup\\\": true | false,\\n  \\\"issues\\\":

Review the following group of orders and determine whether they are efficiently grouped. Perform the following 7 steps and provide small detailed reasoning for each in your final output, structured clearly with sections for each step. For each step, include all calculations, decisions, assumptions, and comparisons made during the evaluation.\\n\\n1. **Calculate Optimal Route Distance**:\\n   - Use the pickupPlace and deliveryPlace coordinates (latitude, longitude) for each order to compute the total distance of an optimized route.\\n   - Optimize the route by prioritizing the pickupTimeWindow and deliveryTimeWindow first, arranging the sequence to respect the earliest start times and avoid conflicts (e.g., start with the earliest pickup, proceed to the next compatible pickup or delivery).\\n   - After time optimization, refine the sequence geographically by minimizing backtracking (e.g., pickup of first order, pickup of second order, then deliveries, or pickup then delivery per order), ending at the last delivery.\\n   - Use Euclidean distance (sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2)) between coordinates if exact routing is unavailable, converting degrees to approximate kilometers (1 degree ≈ 111 km).\\n   - If the calculated distance deviates significantly from real-world estimates (e.g., >20% difference) or cannot be computed accurately due to missing data or complexity, use the provided totalDistance as a fallback (assume it is 90% correct).\\n   - Compare your calculated or fallback distance with the provided totalDistance to assess consistency.\\n   - **Reasoning Requirements**: Explain the time-based sequence chosen (based on pickupTimeWindow and deliveryTimeWindow), refine with geographic optimization, show distance calculations between each pair of locations (or why calculation failed), state whether the calculated or fallback distance was used, and compare it with the provided totalDistance.\\n\\n2. **Calculate Price Per Km**:\\n   - Compute pricePerKm as totalPrice / totalDistance, using the distance determined in Step 1 (calculated or fallback).\\n   - If the fallback totalDistance was used, compare with the provided pricePerKm (assume it is 90% correct) and decide which to adopt.\\n   - Verify that pricePerKm falls within 1.5–2.5 €/km; if outside this range, flag it as an issue.\\n   - **Reasoning Requirements**: Show the exact computation (e.g., totalPrice ÷ totalDistance = pricePerKm), state which distance and pricePerKm values were used, explain if the provided pricePerKm was adopted, and confirm if the result is within the acceptable range.\\n\\n3. **Validate Car Type Compatibility**:\\n   - Check that all orders share the same carTypeName.\\n   - Use these car type constraints:\\n     - **MEGA**: height: 3.0m, length: 13.6m, width: 2.48m, maxWeight: 25.0t, capacity: 34 pallets, loadingMethods: [\\\"Rear\\\", \\\"Side\\\", \\\"Top\\\"]\\n     - **TAUTLINER_PLANA**: height: 2.62m, length: 13.6m, width: 2.46m, maxWeight: 24.0t, capacity: 34 pallets, loadingMethods: [\\\"Rear\\\", \\\"Side\\\", \\\"Top\\\"]\\n     - **Frigo**: height: 2.6m, length: 13.4m, width: 2.46m, maxWeight: 22.0t, capacity: 33 pallets, loadingMethods: [\\\"Rear\\\"]\\n   - Assume orders’ dimensions and loading needs fit unless specified otherwise, but flag if car types differ.\\n   - **Reasoning Requirements**: List the carTypeName for each order, confirm they match, identify the car type used, and verify that its constraints (e.g., maxWeight, capacity) support the group.\\n\\n4. **Check Truck Limits**:\\n   - Ensure total LDM (loading meters) is less than 13.6.\\n   - Ensure total weight is less than the car type’s maxWeight (based on the car type identified in Step 3).\\n   - **Reasoning Requirements**: Provide the calculated total LDM and total weight from the input, state the car type’s limits, and compare these values to confirm compliance or identify violations.\\n\\n5. **Validate Time Windows**:\\n   - Check compatibility of pickupTimeWindow and deliveryTimeWindow for all orders with the optimized route from Step 1.\\n   - Estimate travel time between locations using the totalDistance from Step 1 and an average speed of 60 km/h (distance ÷ 60 = hours).\\n   - Assume pickups and deliveries occur at the start of their respective time windows unless overlap prevents this, then adjust sequence as needed.\\n   - **Reasoning Requirements**: List each order’s pickup and delivery time windows, estimate travel times between stops based on the route, and explain if the sequence satisfies all time constraints or where conflicts arise.\\n\\n6. **Validate ADR Rules**:\\n   - Rules:\\n     - If any order has isAdrOrder: true, all ADR orders must have canGroupWithAdr: true to group together, and all non-ADR orders must have canGroupWithAdr: true to group with ADR orders.\\n     - An ADR order with canGroupWithAdr: false can only group with non-ADR orders that have canGroupWithAdr: false.\\n     - If no orders have isAdrOrder: true (all are non-ADR orders), all orders can group with each other regardless of their canGroupWithAdr values.\\n   - **Reasoning Requirements**: List each order’s isAdrOrder and canGroupWithAdr values, analyze grouping compatibility step-by-step according to the rules, and state whether the group satisfies ADR requirements or where it fails.\\n\\n7. **Check Destination Proximity and Routing**:\\n   - Ensure all pickup and delivery locations are within a 200 km radius, using straight-line distance between coordinates (Euclidean, 1 degree ≈ 111 km).\\n   - Validate cross-country routes (e.g., FR to DE) if present, ensuring they align with the optimized route from Step 1.\\n   - Confirm the route sequence is efficient (e.g., minimizes backtracking or detours).\\n   - **Reasoning Requirements**: Calculate distances between all pairs of pickup and delivery locations, confirm all are within 200 km, verify cross-country validity, describe the route sequence, and explain its optimization or any inefficiencies.\\n\\n**Output Instructions**:\\nReturn a JSON object in this exact format:\\n{\\n  \\\"isGoodGroup\\\": true | false,\\n  \\\"issues\\\":

Review the following group of orders and determine whether they are efficiently grouped. Perform the following 7 steps and provide small detailed reasoning for each in your final output, structured clearly with sections for each step. For each step, include all calculations, decisions, assumptions, and comparisons made during the evaluation.\\n\\n1. **Calculate Optimal Route Distance**:\\n   - Use the pickupPlace and deliveryPlace coordinates (latitude, longitude) for each order to compute the total distance of an optimized route.\\n   - Optimize the route by prioritizing the pickupTimeWindow and deliveryTimeWindow first, arranging the sequence to respect the earliest start times and avoid conflicts (e.g., start with the earliest pickup, proceed to the next compatible pickup or delivery).\\n   - After time optimization, refine the sequence geographically by minimizing backtracking (e.g., pickup of first order, pickup of second order, then deliveries, or pickup then delivery per order), ending at the last delivery.\\n   - Use Euclidean distance (sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2)) between coordinates if exact routing is unavailable, converting degrees to approximate kilometers (1 degree ≈ 111 km).\\n   - If the calculated distance deviates significantly from real-world estimates (e.g., >20% difference) or cannot be computed accurately due to missing data or complexity, use the provided totalDistance as a fallback (assume it is 90% correct).\\n   - Compare your calculated or fallback distance with the provided totalDistance to assess consistency.\\n   - **Reasoning Requirements**: Explain the time-based sequence chosen (based on pickupTimeWindow and deliveryTimeWindow), refine with geographic optimization, show distance calculations between each pair of locations (or why calculation failed), state whether the calculated or fallback distance was used, and compare it with the provided totalDistance.\\n\\n2. **Calculate Price Per Km**:\\n   - Compute pricePerKm as totalPrice / totalDistance, using the distance determined in Step 1 (calculated or fallback).\\n   - If the fallback totalDistance was used, compare with the provided pricePerKm (assume it is 90% correct) and decide which to adopt.\\n   - Verify that pricePerKm falls within 1.5–2.5 €/km; if outside this range, flag it as an issue.\\n   - **Reasoning Requirements**: Show the exact computation (e.g., totalPrice ÷ totalDistance = pricePerKm), state which distance and pricePerKm values were used, explain if the provided pricePerKm was adopted, and confirm if the result is within the acceptable range.\\n\\n3. **Validate Car Type Compatibility**:\\n   - Check that all orders share the same carTypeName.\\n   - Use these car type constraints:\\n     - **MEGA**: height: 3.0m, length: 13.6m, width: 2.48m, maxWeight: 25.0t, capacity: 34 pallets, loadingMethods: [\\\"Rear\\\", \\\"Side\\\", \\\"Top\\\"]\\n     - **TAUTLINER_PLANA**: height: 2.62m, length: 13.6m, width: 2.46m, maxWeight: 24.0t, capacity: 34 pallets, loadingMethods: [\\\"Rear\\\", \\\"Side\\\", \\\"Top\\\"]\\n     - **Frigo**: height: 2.6m, length: 13.4m, width: 2.46m, maxWeight: 22.0t, capacity: 33 pallets, loadingMethods: [\\\"Rear\\\"]\\n   - Assume orders’ dimensions and loading needs fit unless specified otherwise, but flag if car types differ.\\n   - **Reasoning Requirements**: List the carTypeName for each order, confirm they match, identify the car type used, and verify that its constraints (e.g., maxWeight, capacity) support the group.\\n\\n4. **Check Truck Limits**:\\n   - Ensure total LDM (loading meters) is less than 13.6.\\n   - Ensure total weight is less than the car type’s maxWeight (based on the car type identified in Step 3).\\n   - **Reasoning Requirements**: Provide the calculated total LDM and total weight from the input, state the car type’s limits, and compare these values to confirm compliance or identify violations.\\n\\n5. **Validate Time Windows**:\\n   - Check compatibility of pickupTimeWindow and deliveryTimeWindow for all orders with the optimized route from Step 1.\\n   - Estimate travel time between locations using the totalDistance from Step 1 and an average speed of 60 km/h (distance ÷ 60 = hours).\\n   - Assume pickups and deliveries occur at the start of their respective time windows unless overlap prevents this, then adjust sequence as needed.\\n   - **Reasoning Requirements**: List each order’s pickup and delivery time windows, estimate travel times between stops based on the route, and explain if the sequence satisfies all time constraints or where conflicts arise.\\n\\n6. **Validate ADR Rules**:\\n   - Rules:\\n     - If any order has isAdrOrder: true, all ADR orders must have canGroupWithAdr: true to group together, and all non-ADR orders must have canGroupWithAdr: true to group with ADR orders.\\n     - An ADR order with canGroupWithAdr: false can only group with non-ADR orders that have canGroupWithAdr: false.\\n     - If no orders have isAdrOrder: true (all are non-ADR orders), all orders can group with each other regardless of their canGroupWithAdr values.\\n   - **Reasoning Requirements**: List each order’s isAdrOrder and canGroupWithAdr values, analyze grouping compatibility step-by-step according to the rules, and state whether the group satisfies ADR requirements or where it fails.\\n\\n7. **Check Destination Proximity and Routing**:\\n   - Ensure all pickup and delivery locations are within a 200 km radius, using straight-line distance between coordinates (Euclidean, 1 degree ≈ 111 km).\\n   - Validate cross-country routes (e.g., FR to DE) if present, ensuring they align with the optimized route from Step 1.\\n   - Confirm the route sequence is efficient (e.g., minimizes backtracking or detours).\\n   - **Reasoning Requirements**: Calculate distances between all pairs of pickup and delivery locations, confirm all are within 200 km, verify cross-country validity, describe the route sequence, and explain its optimization or any inefficiencies.\\n\\n**Output Instructions**:\\nReturn a JSON object in this exact format:\\n{\\n  \\\"isGoodGroup\\\": true | false,\\n  \\\"issues\\\":

Order 2 (06:00) before Order 1 (08:00).\\n- Geographic refinement: Order 2 Pickup -> Order 1 Pickup -> Order 2 Delivery -> Order 1 Delivery minimizes backtracking.\\n- Distance calculation: Using Euclidean distance (1 degree ≈ 111 km).\\n- Distance (Order 2 Pickup -> Order 1 Pickup): sqrt((51.0529-50.4147)^2 + (10.2475-12.1695)^2) * 111 = sqrt(0.4072 + 3.7248) * 111 = sqrt(4.132) * 111 = 2.0327 * 111 = 225.63 km\\n- Distance (Order 1 Pickup -> Order 2 Delivery): sqrt((50.4147-48.2)^2 + (12.1695-(-0.6667))^2) * 111 = sqrt(4.9066 + 164.71) * 111 = sqrt(169.6166) * 111 = 13.0237 * 111 = 1445.63 km\\n- Distance (Order 2 Delivery -> Order 1 Delivery): sqrt((48.2-47.8876)^2 + (-0.6667-(-0.8512))^2) * 111 = sqrt(0.0976 + 0.0340) * 111 = sqrt(0.1316) * 111 = 0.3628 * 111 = 40.27 km\\n- Total calculated distance: 225.63 + 1445.63 + 40.27 = 1711.53 km\\n- The calculated distance (1711.53 km) deviates significantly from the provided totalDistance (1268.89 km), so using provided totalDistance.\\n\\nStep 2: Price Per Km\\n- Using provided totalDistance (1268.89 km) and totalPrice (2400 €).\\n- pricePerKm = totalPrice / totalDistance = 2400 / 1268.89 = 1.8914 €/km\\n- The calculated pricePerKm (1.8914 €/km) is within the acceptable range of 1.5–2.5 €/km.\\n\\nStep 3: Car Type Compatibility\\n- Order 1 carTypeName: TAUTLINER_PLANA\\n- Order 2 carTypeName: TAUTLINER_PLANA\\n- All orders share the same carTypeName: TAUTLINER_PLANA\\n- Car type TAUTLINER_PLANA constraints: height: 2.62m, length: 13.6m, width: 2.46m, maxWeight: 24.0t, capacity: 34 pallets, loadingMethods: [\\\"Rear\\\", \\\"Side\\\", \\\"Top\\\"]\\n\\nStep 4: Truck Limits\\n- Total LDM: 13.5 (given)\\n- Total weight: 16.5t (given)\\n- Car type TAUTLINER_PLANA limits: length: 13.6 LDM, maxWeight: 24.0t\\n- Total LDM (13.5) is less than the limit (13.6).\\n- Total weight (16.5t) is less than the limit (24.0t).\\n\\nStep 5: Time Windows\\n- Order 1: Pickup (2025-03-21T08:00 to 2025-03-21T14:00), Delivery (2025-03-24T08:00 to 2025-03-25T14:00)\\n- Order 2: Pickup (2025-03-21T06:00 to 2025-03-21T18:00), Delivery (2025-03-24T08:00 to 2025-03-24T12:00)\\n- Route: Order 2 Pickup -> Order 1 Pickup -> Order 2 Delivery -> Order 1 Delivery\\n- Travel time (1268.89 km / 60 km/h) = 21.15 hours\\n- Order 2 Pickup starts at 2025-03-21T06:00. Travel to Order 1 Pickup (225.63 km / 60 km/h = 3.76 hours). Order 1 Pickup starts at 2025-03-21T08:00. Arrival at Order 1 Pickup: 06:00 + 3.76 hours = ~09:46. OK.\\n- Travel to Order 2 Delivery (1445.63 km / 60 km/h = 24.09 hours). Order 2 Delivery starts at 2025-03-24T08:00. Arrival at Order 2 Delivery: 09:46 (March 21) + 24.09 hours = ~09:51 (March 22) + 24 hours = 09:51 (March 23) + 0.09 hours = ~9:56 (March 24). OK.\\n- Travel to Order 1 Delivery (40.27 km / 60 km/h = 0.67 hours). Order 1 Delivery starts at 2025-03-24T08:00. Arrival at Order 1 Delivery: 09:56 + 0.67 hours = ~10:36 (March 24). OK.\\n\\nStep 6: ADR Rules\\n- Order 1: isAdrOrder = false, canGroupWithAdr = false\\n- Order 2: isAdrOrder = false, canGroupWithAdr = false\\n- Since no orders are ADR orders, the canGroupWithAdr values do not affect grouping.  However, since both orders have canGroupWithAdr = false, they should only be grouped with other orders that also have canGroupWithAdr = false. This condition is met, so there is no ADR issue.\\n\\nStep 7: Destination Proximity and Routing\\n- All pickup and delivery locations should be within a 200 km radius of each other.\\n- Distance (Order 1 Pickup to Order 2 Pickup): 225.63 km (calculated in Step 1). This exceeds 200 km.\\n- Distance (Order 1 Pickup to Order 1 Delivery): sqrt((50.4147-47.8876)^2 + (12.1695-(-0.8512))^2) * 111 = sqrt(6.3853 + 170.02) * 111 = 13.2068 * 111 = 1466 km\\n- Distance (Order 1 Pickup to Order 2 Delivery): 1445.63 km\\n- Distance (Order 2 Pickup to Order 1 Delivery): sqrt((51.0529-47.8876)^2 + (10.2475-(-0.8512))^2) * 111 = sqrt(10.027 + 123.18) * 111 = 11.5409 * 111 = 1280 km\\n- Distance (Order 2 Pickup to Order 2 Delivery): sqrt((51.0529-48.2)^2 + (10.2475-(-0.6667))^2) * 111 = sqrt(8.14 + 118.99) * 111 = 11.2752 * 111 = 1251 km\\n- Distance (Order 1 Delivery to Order 2 Delivery): 40.27 km\\n- Several distances are greater than 200km.\\n- Cross-country route: DE to FR. The route is valid.\\n- Route sequence: Order 2 Pickup -> Order 1 Pickup -> Order 2 Delivery -> Order 1 Delivery.
